This is my web development toolbox.





I use a MacBook Pro with 8GB RAM, with an external monitor.





And these are the apps I use:





[Alfred](http://www.alfredapp.com/)







  * App launcher, file/web searcher, iTunes controller, and so much more!


  * For me, it replaced QuickSilver, which had replaced the built-in Spotlight.


  * Mapped to Command-Space





[Notational Velocity](http://notational.net/)







  * Superb note-taking.


  * Syncs with [Simplenote](http://simplenoteapp.com/) web version, which syncs with the [iPhone/iPad app](http://itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewSoftware?id=289429962&mt=8&ign-mpt=uo%3D6) -- notes everywhere!


  * Accessed with Command-Shift-V





[Dropbox](http://db.tt/SMSGGiL) (Referral link)







  * Adds a Dropbox folder to your computer that is synced across all devices. Works everywhere (Windows/Mac/Linux/iOS).


  * This is a good roundup of Dropbox tips: [The Ultimate Dropbox Toolkit & Guide](http://web.appstorm.net/roundups/data-management-roundups/the-ultimate-dropbox-toolkit-guide/)





To Do / Task Management







  * For personal tasks, I'm using [OmniFocus for Mac](http://www.omnigroup.com/products/omnifocus/) and [OmniFocus for iPhone](http://www.omnigroup.com/products/omnifocus-iphone/).


  * For work tasks, I use [Things for Mac](http://culturedcode.com/things/), and will probably get the iPhone app soon.





[TotalFinder](http://totalfinder.binaryage.com/)







  * Adds tabs to the OS X Finder


  * Essential to reduce window clutter!





[Sublime Text 2](http://www.sublimetext.com/)







  * Supersedes TextMate. Best with [Vintage mode](http://www.sublimetext.com/docs/2/vintage.html).





Vim Browser Extensions







  * These extensions provide Vim keybindings for web browsing.


  * Super-useful in my quest to never touch my mouse...


  * [Vimium](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/dbepggeogbaibhgnhhndojpepiihcmeb) in Chrome


  * [Vimperator](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/vimperator/) in Firefox





[Photoshop](http://www.photoshop.com/products/photoshop)





[Firefox](http://www.mozilla.com/) with [Firebug](http://getfirebug.com/)







  * <del> Still the best for development, though Chrome's dev tools are quite good</del>


  * Use mostly Chrome these days.





[Google Chrome](http://www.google.com/chrome/)







  * For <del>anything other than development</del> everything. Super fast!





[Transmit](http://www.panic.com/transmit/)







  * FTP app, can also access S3 buckets. Don't use FTP much anymore though...





[1Password](http://agilebits.com/products/1Password)







  * Keep all your passwords in one place, and also good for storing software keys, and "wallet backup"





[Adium](http://adium.im/)







  * IM client, not much to say here





[Cloud App](http://getcloudapp.com/)







  * Best Feature: Auto-uploads screenshots and adds the URL to your clipboard





[Hazel](http://www.noodlesoft.com/hazel.php)







  * Helps keep files organized


  * Can run rules like "make files in the Downloads folder red that are older than 3 days"





[Sequel Pro](http://www.sequelpro.com/)







  * MySQL GUI





[Divvy](http://mizage.com/#macdivvy)







  * Essential window management for large screens





Dotfiles







  * [https://github.com/nomatteus/dotfiles](https://github.com/nomatteus/dotfiles)





And some online services I pay for _(some of these are affiliate links)_:







  * <del>[Github](https://github.com/)</del> [Codebase](http://www.codebasehq.com/)  (See [this post](http://matthewruten.com/2011/10/30/github-vs-codebase-vs-gitorious-best-options-for-hosting-personal-projects/) for why.)


  * [Linode](http://www.linode.com/?r=0ed1244fbf3f53d5368bdb863f685643b9744043) (VPS)


  * [Webfaction](http://www.webfaction.com?affiliate=ruten) (Hosting for side projects/staging sites.)

  * [Jungle Disk](https://www.jungledisk.com/) (To back up my work and home computers.)


  * [Amazon Web Services](http://aws.amazon.com/) (S3: Static asset hosting, and backup archival)


  * <del>[Netflix](http://netflix.ca)</del> (Cancelled this for now. I was barley using it, and seldom watch TV/movies these days.)


  * [Rdio](www.rdio.com) (Great selection of music. I pay for the Unlimited plan, which allows syncing to your mobile. Replaces iTunes except for albums Rdio doesn't have.)
