This is my web development toolbox.

I use a MacBook Pro with 8GB RAM, with an external monitor.

And these are the apps I use:

[Alfred](http://www.alfredapp.com/)

* App launcher, file/web searcher, iTunes controller, and so much more!
* For me, it replaced QuickSilver, which had replaced the built-in Spotlight.
* Mapped to Command-Space

[nvALT](http://brettterpstra.com/projects/nvalt/) 
(Previously [Notational Velocity](http://notational.net/))

* Superb note-taking.
* Syncs with Dropbox, which syncs to [Notesy iOS App](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/notesy-for-dropbox/id386095500?mt=8) -- notes everywhere!
* Accessed with Command-Shift-V

[Dropbox](http://db.tt/SMSGGiL) (Referral link)

* Adds a Dropbox folder to your computer that is synced across all devices. Works everywhere (Windows/Mac/Linux/iOS).
* This is a good roundup of Dropbox tips: [The Ultimate Dropbox Toolkit & Guide](http://web.appstorm.net/roundups/data-management-roundups/the-ultimate-dropbox-toolkit-guide/)

To Do / Task Management

* For personal tasks, I'm using OmniFocus for [Mac](http://www.omnigroup.com/products/omnifocus/), [iPhone](http://www.omnigroup.com/products/omnifocus-iphone/), and [iPad](http://www.omnigroup.com/products/omnifocus-ipad/).
* For work tasks, I use [Things for Mac](http://culturedcode.com/things/), and the companion [iPhone App](http://culturedcode.com/things/iphone/).

[TotalFinder](http://totalfinder.binaryage.com/)

* Adds tabs to the OS X Finder
* Essential to reduce window clutter!

[Sublime Text 2](http://www.sublimetext.com/)

* Supersedes TextMate. Best with [Vintage mode](http://www.sublimetext.com/docs/2/vintage.html).
* Some Useful Packages: [Package Control](http://wbond.net/sublime_packages/package_control), [GitGutter](https://github.com/jisaacks/GitGutter), [Git](https://github.com/kemayo/sublime-text-2-git), [RubyTest](https://github.com/maltize/sublime-text-2-ruby-tests), [SublimeCodeIntel](https://github.com/Kronuz/SublimeCodeIntel)
* [Nil UI Theme](https://github.com/nilium/st2-nil-theme) (with Tubnil color scheme)
* [View my Prefs etc. on GitHub](https://github.com/nomatteus/Sublime-Text-2-Prefs---Plugins)

Vim Browser Extensions

* These extensions provide Vim keybindings for web browsing.
* Super-useful in my quest to never touch my mouse...
* [Vimium](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/dbepggeogbaibhgnhhndojpepiihcmeb) in Chrome

[Photoshop](http://www.photoshop.com/products/photoshop)

* And other apps, as part of [Creative Cloud](http://www.adobe.com/products/creativecloud.html)

[Chrome](https://www.google.com/intl/en/chrome/browser/)

* Use mostly Chrome these days.
* Extensions: 
[Vimium](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/vimium/dbepggeogbaibhgnhhndojpepiihcmeb), 
[Disconnect](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/disconnect/jeoacafpbcihiomhlakheieifhpjdfeo), 
[Reddit Enhancement Suite](http://redditenhancementsuite.com/), 
[Imgur the World](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/imgur-the-world/naicjelodgogagjjkgepdkjecopegkag), 
[Ghostery](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ghostery/mlomiejdfkolichcflejclcbmpeaniij)

[Transmit](http://www.panic.com/transmit/)

* FTP app, can also access S3 buckets. Don't use FTP much anymore though...

[1Password](http://agilebits.com/products/1Password)

* Keep all your passwords in one place, and also good for storing software keys, and "wallet backup"

[Adium](http://adium.im/)

* IM client, not much to say here

[Cloud App](http://getcloudapp.com/)

* Best Feature: Auto-uploads screenshots and adds the URL to your clipboard

[Hazel](http://www.noodlesoft.com/hazel.php)

* Helps keep files organized
* Can run rules like "make files in the Downloads folder red that are older than 3 days"

[Sequel Pro](http://www.sequelpro.com/)

* MySQL GUI

[pgAdmin](http://www.pgadmin.org/)

* Postgres GUI

[Spectacle](http://spectacleapp.com/)

* Essential window management for large screens
