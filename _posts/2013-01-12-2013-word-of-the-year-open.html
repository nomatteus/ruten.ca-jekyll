<p>My word/manifesto/goal/guiding principle of 2012 was: "Create"</p>

<p>That still applies, but I thought it would be a good exercise to choose a new word for 2013. And that word is: "Open".</p>

<p>This applies to my work: instead of hosting my side projects on private repositories, I will keep them public, whenever possible. (Doesn't apply to work for my company or clients, of course!)</p>

<p>To kick that off, I've pushed a few repos:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/nomatteus/goals-app">https://github.com/nomatteus/goals-app</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/nomatteus/daily-ebook-deals">https://github.com/nomatteus/daily-ebook-deals</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/nomatteus/to-transit">https://github.com/nomatteus/to-transit</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/nomatteus/dinesafe">https://github.com/nomatteus/dinesafe</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/nomatteus/dinesafe-ios">https://github.com/nomatteus/dinesafe-ios</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/nomatteus/litsum">https://github.com/nomatteus/litsum</a></li>
</ul>

<p>First immediate benefit of working on a public repository: can't take shortcuts like hard-coding API keys in my code (had to strip some of those out/change &amp; invalidate API keys from some of the above repositories).</p>

<hr />

<p>What about personally? What does it mean to be open?</p>

<ul>
<li>It means less hesitation when talking about myself. </li>
<li>It means giving my honest thoughts &amp; opinions whenever possible.</li>
<li>It means being more outgoing. </li>
<li>It means being more vulnerable to what other people think; it means worrying less about what other people think. </li>
<li>It means posting more of my writing publicly. </li>
<li>It means updating my blog more often.</li>
</ul>

<p>I'm not really sure that this is a good idea, but I'm going to give it a shot.</p>
