1Password is a great program, but one thing it doesn't handle well is multiple password databases. I use 1Password at work and at home, and sometimes I want to access my home password database. To view another database, you have to go to "<em>Preferences</em>", and "<em>Choose Another Data File...</em>", find your file, then repeat to switch back to your main database. Pretty clunky.

Luckily, for read-only access, you can open the <em>1Password.html</em> file and view your passwords in a basic interface using a web browser (if you're using Finder on Mac OS X, right-click your <em>1Password.agilekeychain</em> file and choose "<em>Show Package Contents</em>" to see the HTML file).

However, if you're using Google Chrome, you will see this:

<h3>How to Fix the "Problem loading 1Password data file" Error</h3>
A simple solution is on the <a href="http://help.agile.ws/1Password3/1passwordanywhere_troubleshooting.html" target="_blank">1Password web site</a>:
<blockquote>The easiest way to workaround this is to store your 1Password.agilekeychain file on a web server or service like Dropbox. If you need offline access to 1PasswordAnywhere you will need to use another browser or modify Chrome’s settings by adding the –allow-file-access-from-files command line option.</blockquote>
A more complex solution is below.

The end result is being able to <strong>access your 1Password at http://1p.local</strong> (or domain of your choosing). This is probably only worth doing if you already run a web server locally.

1.<strong> Add a line to your <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hosts_(file)#Location_in_the_file_system" target="_blank">hosts</a> file </strong>(<em>/etc/hosts</em> on Mac OS X/*nix, <em>c:windowssystem32driversetc</em> on Windows) to point the address you choose to your local computer:
<blockquote>
<pre>127.0.0.1    1p.local</pre>
</blockquote>
The <em>1p.local</em> address can be whatever you like. I like this address because Chrome will remember it and I can launch it by pressing <em>1</em> then <em>return</em>.

2.<strong> Add a virtual host to your Apache httpd.conf file</strong>:
<blockquote>
<pre>&lt;VirtualHost *:80&gt;
    DirectoryIndex 1Password.html
    DocumentRoot /Users/myusername/Dropbox/1Password.agilekeychain/
    ServerName 1p.local # Change this if you like
&lt;/VirtualHost&gt;</pre>
</blockquote>
Make sure the DocumentRoot is the correct path to your 1Password.agilekeychain.

I also added another few lines (still in the httpd.conf file) to disallow anyone on the same network from accessing the file (even though it's not too likely):
<blockquote>
<pre>&lt;Directory "/Users/myusername/Dropbox/1Password.agilekeychain/"&gt;
    Options All
    Order deny,allow
    Deny from all
    Allow from 127.0.0.1 # localhost
&lt;/Directory&gt;</pre>
</blockquote>
3. <strong>That's it!</strong> Make sure to restart Apache so the changes will take effect.

Now, you should be able to access your 1Password HTML file through any browser (including Chrome!) at http://1p.local.
