_Note (May 31, 2012): This was accurate as of April 2011, and may not work on the newer Kindles. I used this information to get custom screensavers on my Kindle Keyboard (as it is now called)._

_Note: This applies to the Kindle 3 running the latest software update, 3.1. For Kindle 2 and Kindle 3 running pre-3.1 software, see the Mobile Read [forums](http://www.mobileread.com/forums/showthread.php?t=88004) or [wiki](http://wiki.mobileread.com/wiki/Kindle_Hacks_Information)._
