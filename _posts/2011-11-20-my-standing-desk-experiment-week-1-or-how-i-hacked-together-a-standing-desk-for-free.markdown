In the past couple years, I've [read][marksdailyapple] [many][hivelogic] [blog][nerdfitness] [posts][smarterware] and [news stories][blogs] about how sitting is killing us, and we were not made to sit stationary for hours at a time. Along with that, [more][jessenoller] and [more][lifebyexperimentation] people are trying out standing desks, to avoid some of the pitfalls of sitting.

I like the idea of standing desks, but don't really want to invest any money into it until I try it out, so I hacked one together with stuff I already have:

![](/images/content/2011/11/standing-desk.jpg)

It's just a table on a table, with some stuff on the ground to stand on, to reach the right height.

Some initial notes:
	
* Sore feet! I've only spent a few hours standing so far, but my feet get quite sore. Walking around once in a while helps!
* Typing feels much more natural. I think this is the first time I'm actually typing in an ergonomically-correct way, and it feels great!
* I probably need a stand for my monitor, so I don't have to look down at it.
* I walk around a lot more, and can easily pace back and forth when I need to think about a problem.

Where to go from here?
	
* Standing desk or not, I need to get an actual desk. The [Frederik](http://www.ikea.com/ca/en/catalog/products/60111123/) desk from Ikea is adjustable, so it should work as either a standing or sitting desk.

* I'll try this out for a few weeks and see how it goes! I only use this computer on evenings and weekends, so it's not too crazy to stand for those times.

_Side note: Also visible in the photo is the exercise ball I was using as a chair previously.Â _
