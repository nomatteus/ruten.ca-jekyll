In the past couple years, I've <a href="http://www.marksdailyapple.com/standing-at-work/" target="_blank">read</a> <a href="http://hivelogic.com/articles/sitting-standing-balance-ball/" target="_blank">many</a> <a href="http://nerdfitness.com/blog/2011/08/15/standing/" target="_blank">blog</a> <a href="http://smarterware.org/7102/how-and-why-i-switched-to-a-standing-desk" target="_blank">posts</a> and <a href="http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/02/23/stand-up-while-you-read-this/" target="_blank">news stories</a> about how sitting is killing us, and we were not made to sit stationary for hours at a time. Along with that, <a href="http://jessenoller.com/2011/04/25/switching-to-a-standing-desk-thoughts/" target="_blank">more</a> and <a href="http://lifebyexperimentation.com/2011/03/experiment-the-standing-desk/" target="_blank">more</a> people are trying out standing desks, to avoid some of the pitfalls of sitting.

I like the idea of standing desks, but don't really want to invest any money into it until I try it out, so I hacked one together with stuff I already have:

<a href="http://ruten.ca/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/standing-desk.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-610" title="standing-desk" src="http://ruten.ca/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/standing-desk.jpg" alt="" width="288" height="451" /></a>

It's just a table on a table, with some stuff on the ground to stand on, to reach the right height.

Some initial notes:
<ul>
	<li>Sore feet! I've only spent a few hours standing so far, but my feet get quite sore. Walking around once in a while helps!</li>
	<li>Typing feels much more natural. I think this is the first time I'm actually typing in an ergonomically-correct way, and it feels great!</li>
	<li>I probably need a stand for my monitor, so I don't have to look down at it.</li>
	<li>I walk around a lot more, and can easily pace back and forth when I need to think about a problem.</li>
</ul>
Where to go from here?
<ul>
	<li>Standing desk or not, I need to get an actual desk. The <a href="http://www.ikea.com/ca/en/catalog/products/60111123/" target="_blank">Frederik</a> desk from Ikea is adjustable, so it should work as either a standing or sitting desk.</li>
	<li>I'll try this out for a few weeks and see how it goes! I only use this computer on evenings and weekends, so it's not too crazy to stand for those times.</li>
</ul>
