## Recipe

Carefully add each layer to a flat glass pan. Or, use several smaller square containers.
For quantities, use what feels right.

1. Can of refried beans. (heat up first, and optionally mix in some taco/tex-mex spice, and/or can of chopped green chilis, and/or hot sauce)
2. Sour Cream (optionally mix with some cream cheese and/or taco seasoning)
3. Shredded/grated Cheese (cheddar, montary jack, or nacho/texmex cheese blend)
4. Guacamole (or mash 2-3 avocados with salt, pepper, lemon juice, garlic powder)
5. Salsa
6. Green Onions
7. Chopped tomatoes

Finish by topping with some more cheese, and add olives if desired.

## Ideas for making it healthier

* Make a healthier homemade version of refried beans. Google it for different options, but one possibility is mashing up black or pinto beans and then frying with some olive oil and spices.
* Use lower fat sour cream.
* Add more fresh veggies (maybe try green peppers)
* Try doing a 50/50 mix with sour cream & greek yogurt.
