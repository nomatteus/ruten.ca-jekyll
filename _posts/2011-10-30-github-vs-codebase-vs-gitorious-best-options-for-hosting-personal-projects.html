First of all, I love Github. We use it at work, and it works great. The code browsing, and ability to make quick edits and commit them within Github are awesome features. I've been using it for some personal projects, but it quickly gets expensive if you want to host more than 10 repos.

Here's a quick comparison of the features I care about the most:
<table class="clearfix" style="clear: both; border-width: 0px; border-color: #fcfcfc !important; border-style: solid;" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="4">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td style="border-width: initial; border-color: initial; border-style: none;"></td>
<td><a href="https://github.com/plans" target="_blank">Github</a></td>
<td><a href="http://www.codebasehq.com/packages" target="_blank">Codebase</a></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Repositories</td>
<td>5</td>
<td>Unlimited</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Disk Space</td>
<td>~615MB</td>
<td>500MB</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Collaborators</td>
<td>1</td>
<td>9</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Price</td>
<td>$7/month</td>
<td>$7.56/month</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
The key is unlimited repositories, with only a limit on space. This is perfect for hosting a large amount of small projects. Most of my repos are only a few MB.

It turns out there are a ton of repository hosting sites--Codebase was the only one I found that had a limit on space, instead of number of repositories, and also had extra project features, like time tracking, code browsing/editing, etc.

So the plan for now is to move all my private Github repos to Codebase.

One last option is to host your Git repos on your own server. I looked into a few self-hosted options, <a href="http://gitorious.org/gitorious/pages/Installation" target="_blank">Gitorious </a>looks the most promising, but is apparently a bit tricky to install. I'm adding it to the "look in to someday" list.
