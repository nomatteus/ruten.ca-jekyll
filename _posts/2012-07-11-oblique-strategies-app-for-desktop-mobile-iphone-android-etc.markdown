**What are Oblique Strategies?**

From [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oblique_Strategies):

> Oblique Strategies (subtitled Over One Hundred Worthwhile Dilemmas) is a deck of 7x9 cm printed cards in a black container box, created by Brian Eno and Peter Schmidt and first published in 1975. Each card offers an aphorism intended to help artists (particularly musicians) break creative blocks.

**The Idea**

I came across oblique strategies a few years ago, and have always loved the idea. I didn't actually purchase a deck, because it was quite expensive. Also, I like digital things. I created a simple [Wordpress plugin](https://github.com/nomatteus/oblique-strategies-wp) a while ago, but wanted an app I could use on my smartphone.

**The Site**

This is a mobile web app, so try visiting it from your mobile device. It will also work on any desktop browser.

You can view app at [http://obliquestrategies.ca](http://obliquestrategies.ca) or [http://obstrat.net](http://obstrat.net).

**Tech Notes**

* [HTML5 Mobile Boilerplate](http://html5boilerplate.com/mobile) saves you a ton of work by gathering all the different `meta` tags, icons for your web apps, CSS reset/defaults all in one place.
* Random fonts from [Google Web Fonts](http://www.google.com/webfonts).
* Faves stored using HTML5 localStorage
* Uses HTML5 application cache to allow the app to work offline
